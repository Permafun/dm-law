A key to every business venture is a strong foundation.

However, there is no routine process for everyone because each business has its own unique needs. Our law firm can help navigate the law to ensure that your business is formed in a way that maximizes its potential and limits liability.

We can help you choose the correct type of entity based on your specific needs; these include:

|                                    |                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Limited Liability Companies (LLC)  | Limited Partnerships (LP)                     |
| Corporations (C-Corp)              | Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP)          |
| Nonprofits and tax-exempt entities | Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC) |
| Sole proprietorship                | Professional Corporation (PC)                 |
| General Partnerships (GP)          | Professional Association (PA)                 |

## Certificate of Formation or Articles of Incorporation

We will prepare your Certificate of Formation or Articles of Incorporation following all legal formalities and assist in filing it with the Secretary of State so that your business can begin operating without delay.

## Bylaws or Operating agreement

According to your guidelines, we will draft your Bylaws or Operating agreement to guarantee that your business’ internal affairs are conducted the way you intended.

## Tax Planning

Dyer & Mauro can assist in organizing your business structure in a way to help you maximize profits and minimize tax liability. Additionally, we can help educate your governing persons on common tax triggering events to help you avoid unnecessary tax liability in the future.

## Drafting or Reviewing Financing Agreement

When you require a loan to start your new business, a financing agreement outlines the terms of the loan. We can either review the financing agreement provided by your lender so that you understand what you agree to, or we can assist in drafting a financing agreement.

## Compliance with local, state, and federal laws and ordinances and standards

Forming a business is more than just filing the proper forms; it is making sure you are legally allowed to operate. We also help you research and confirm that the way and where you intend to conduct your business complies with all laws, ordinances, and standards of the area you will operate.

## Name registration/trademark

We will file your name with the Secretary of State for you to start your business. Additionally, our attorneys can help ensure that your chosen name does not run afoul of any existing state or federal trademarks, as well as helping you register a state or federal trademark for your business.

## Dissolution – Winding Up

Whether your business has run its course or you want to pursue other life paths, the dissolution of a business creates duties and obligations that can lead to liability for the business owners.

It is essential to ensure that you fulfill your obligations to your business, fellow owners, creditors, and the government in winding up your business. Failing to fulfill an obligation could leave you open to fines or lawsuits.

If you need assistance in making sure all steps have been taken for a proper dissolution, contact us, and we can assist you in closing your business.
