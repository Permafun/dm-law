## Adoption/Fostering

We assist with private adoptions, including stepparent adoptions, relative adoptions, and adoptions between same-sex couples. Adoptions often involve terminating the biological parents’ rights and determining where the suit for adoption should be filed. Dyer & Mauro is here to assist with these complex issues.

## Divorce

No matter who initiates it, divorces can be difficult times for everyone involved. No one expects that their marriage is going to fail. Sometimes issues can be resolved amicably, sometimes litigation is necessary. We handle both contested and non-contested divorces and ensure that your divorce is handled with care.

## Child Custody

Child custody, known in Texas as conservatorship, is often a point of contention in divorces. Conservatorship involves determining the rights and duties assigned to each parent with respect to their child and deciding with whom the child lives or how much time is spent with either parent.

## Child Support

The court often awards child support in any suit affecting the parent-child relationship, such as divorce. We can assist in helping you understand how much child support you expect to pay or how much you will expect to be paid.

## Enforcements

After the courts have placed an order affecting child support, child custody, or any order resulting from a family law matter, it can become stressful when the other party fails to comply with the court order. You may be able to ask the court to enforce its order if the other person fails to pay child support, fails to turn over property awarded to you in a divorce, or fails to adhere to visitation schedules or other duties regarding the children. We can help by seeking an enforcement order on your behalf.

## Premarital Agreements & Postmarital agreements

Whether before marriage or after marriage, we recommend having an agreement made to protect you and your spouse’s assets.

These agreements are used for more than just planning in case of divorce. Pre and Postmarital agreements could also be used to help protect your assets from creditors as well.

Contact [Dyer & Mauro](/contact), and we can see if one of these agreements is right for you.

Sometimes the law touches those aspects of our lives that are most precious. Any time the law gets involved with family matters, we understand how stressful the situation can be. We are here to assist you with your family law matters because we know how important your family is to you.

We guide our clients through the intricacies of divorce to try to achieve a fair division of marital assets. Additionally, we help our clients agree with their spouses on a mutually agreeable child support and child custody plan. If a child support or child custody plan cannot be agreed upon, then we will fight in the courts for our clients. Additionally, our office can assist you in any court order enforcements, CPS interventions, or adoptions.
