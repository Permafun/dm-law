## Search

If you have bought goods or services, chances are you have encountered Trademarks or Servicemarks. Trademark law involves the name of your business, logo, the design of your packages, or anything that makes your goods or services unique.

It is important to consult with a trademark attorney before building your brand. It can be disastrous for a company to invest time, effort, and money into building a specific brand only to discover that they must start all over because they inadvertently infringed on another’s trademark. Our attorneys can conduct extensive trademark searches to ensure that when you start putting money and effort into your brand, you are avoiding unnecessary liability.

## Registration

The trademark registration process is full of pitfalls that can postpone or prevent someone’s registration. Our attorneys have experience navigating through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They will help register your mark and handle any disputes with the USPTO on your behalf.

There are many benefits to going through the trademark process. Trademark protection establishes priority in the use of the mark and prevents others from profiting from your brand. Trademarking your brand can save an immense amount of litigation fees should you have to go to court to enforce your trademark rights or someone wrongfully sues you because of your brand.
