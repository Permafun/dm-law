## Dying Without a Will and Intestate Succession

Dying without a Will means someone has passed intestate. When someone dies intestate, their property is distributed to their heirs at law in a process called “intestate succession.”

Intestate Succession can be a complicated process. Depending on the estate of your recently passed loved one, the court may appoint a Personal Representative, called the Executor, to facilitate the distribution of assets. If you wish to be the personal representative or need help starting the processes, contact [Dyer & Mauro](/contact). We can help you and your family ease through the process and the legal intricacies of your position.

## Dying With a Will and Testate Succession

When someone dies with a properly executed Will, and after it is admitted, the deceased’s estate must go through the probate process. The administration of the estate can either be independent or dependent, both methods having vastly different responsibilities for the Executor of the estate. In either scenario, it is suggested that a probate lawyer assist the administrator of the estate in filing necessary forms, distributing assets, and navigating the courts.

If your loved one passed with a Will and you have been named Independent Executor or Dependent Executor, or you aren’t sure which. We can provide you with a probate attorney to assist in admitting the Will to probate and help ease the probate process during a time that is already difficult for you and your family.
