If you have a formula, process, secret recipe, or any other secret thing that gives your business an edge in the industry, you can benefit by establishing trade secret protection.

A trade secret can be almost anything that provides an economic and competitive advantage so long as it remains confidential. Unfortunately, trade secret protection can be easily lost should you fail to uphold the legal requirements of the Texas Uniform Trade Secret Act.

We help draft nondisclosures for your employees as well as other business contacts. We assist in drafting licensing and assignment agreements to ensure you can conduct business with your trade secret without voiding its protection. Dyer & Mauro can provide a trade secret attorney to be an advisor that helps protect your confidential information. Contact us today to see if trade secret protection is the best route for you and your company.
