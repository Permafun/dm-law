## Will Bundles

You’ve spent your whole life working hard; what we can do is help ensure that your hard-earned assets go to who you want upon your passing. Our attorneys will work with you one on one to guarantee that your assets, otherwise known as your estate, are handled exactly how you want upon your passing. We will meet with you, find out your goals, write your Will, and ensure that all the legal formalities are followed so that you can be sure that your family, your friends, or whomever you wish is secure in their future.

Our Will’s Bundle will provide everything you need for a flat fee. The Will Bundle includes:

- Last Will and Testament
- Trusts and Guardianships for minor children
- Medical and Durable power of attorney
- Advance Directives
- Signing Ceremony
- Notary service

When you have family events such as a wedding, divorce, or the birth of a child, your estate plan will need to be updated. The law firm of Dyer & Mauro are here to help you with that process. We offer codicils that are meant to make minor adjustments to your Will, or if necessary, we can draft a new Will that covers all of your needs.

We can also draft a ladybird deed or payable on death to avoid your home from having to go through the probate process.

If you pass without a will, often your family is not only dealing with the loss of a loved one, but there could also be disagreements with how your estate should be distributed. Don’t leave the distribution of your estate up to chance. Contact us today to learn about our Will Bundles.

## Trust Bundles

A Trust is an alternative way to transfer assets while adding multiple layers of protection. Trusts have multiple uses and purposes. They can be used to limit or even eliminate probate, protect assets from creditors, and provide you better control of the use of such assets should something happen to you. Trusts are a great tool when planning out your estate because they can be tailored to your goals.

Some purposes that Trusts can be used for include caring for minors, assistance for the mentally impaired, avoiding probate, or if you want to prevent your children from blowing it all on a weekend trip to Cancun.

Our Trust Bundle consists of everything offered in our Will Bundle plus the added benefit of a Trust personalized for your specific needs.

If a Trust is what you need or want to hear more, contact one of our attorneys for a free 15-minute one-on-one consultation.

## Will Contests

Sometimes, beneficiaries dispute whether the Will was executed under the correct legal formalities such as capacity, fraud, or duress. Suppose you believe a Will is wrongfully disputed or that the Will was wrongfully executed; the attorneys at Dyer & Mauro can protect your interest or the interest of the recently departed.
