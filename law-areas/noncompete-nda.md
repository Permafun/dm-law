## Non-compete

A non-compete agreement ensures that a company can help protect its investment in its employees. A non-compete can help ensure that the time and effort you take to instill your employees with proprietary information cannot be turned around and used against your business.

While non-compete agreements are enforceable in Texas, there is a fine line between those that are and those that are not enforceable. A non-compete must be reasonable in time, geographic location, and scope of activities prevented for it to be enforceable. Because of the requirements for an enforceable agreement, no form agreement will work for every situation. Each agreement must be drafted based on the specific job position and the business operated.

We can help you navigate these requirements to help ensure that your non-compete agreement is enforceable and that your confidential information remains protected. Contact us for more information on how we can help you draft or analyze your non-compete agreements.

## Nondisclosure Agreement
